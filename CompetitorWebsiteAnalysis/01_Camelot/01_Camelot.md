## First impressions:

- It's using GoDaddy website builder based on the meta data:

```html
<meta name="generator" content="Starfield Technologies; Go Daddy Website Builder 8.0.0000">
```

## The Good:

- Some of the buttons have a cool hover effect, offset light grey or slightly transparent bg and on hover it smoothly comes into one uniform button

- The topmost section of the https://mhfenceco.com/fence-permits page looks okay, the numbered list items could use a bit of individual padding or gap, but the section beneath listing city permit info is a bit long on desktop, splitting that into multiple columns on tablet & desktop would clean the look of that long list a bit

- The top nav and sidebar nav on mobile look decent

- The tablet & desktop views for most of the pages feel a bit neglected, maybe a mobile first paradigm gone too far situation?

## The Bad:

- Content and overall layout seems pretty inconsistent overall, some sections have this soft pink background-color: rgb(254, 241, 238); I would probably ditch that or ensure the other content sections were utilizing it in some way

- Inconsistent font family selection, going from 'Poppins' to 'Abril' font from section to section is a bit of a design anti-pattern, I would stick to just one or the other

- The design theory seems a bit lost, not a lot of visual cohesion going from section to section, many of the images are of differing size which is okay for a mosaic layout, or even some general galleries but for info containers it doesn't look great from a design perspective

- The google reviews section is a bit jarring, they'd need to either restructure it completely or add a dark bg overlay on the background image

- The text beneath the Google maps section 'MH Fence Services the greater Denver Metro Area including but not limited to: Arvada, ...' doesn't look great visually

- The awards and affiliations sections are in need of a re-design, the spacing on the awards and the layout overall needs a lot of refinement, everything looks a bit tacked on

- The https://mhfenceco.com/areas-we-serve page hero container seems to have been forgotten about, not a lot going on in the section, and misaligned button element on this page https://mhfenceco.com/areas-we-serve

- The blog page only has a single blog post, I would recommend having a semi-regular blog post, it shows brand trust
