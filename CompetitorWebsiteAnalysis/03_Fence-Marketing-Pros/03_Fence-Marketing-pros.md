## First impressions

Appears to be using WordPress, pretty simplistic clean design, most pages follow a very uniform design strategy, use of a main hero image with h1 or h2 overlayed over, then below they utilize a checkerboard layout pattern usually providing a background offset div behind each main section image

## The Good 

They implement an effective strategy around text overlay, use of thick font weight, with text shadow when overlaying text on images 

They use line height effectively for better readability on many of their content sections 

The text for all content sections is very legible

Use of very subtle background gradients provides a clean look: background-image: linear-gradient(180deg, #0b4163, #125790);

## The Bad

Some of the line-height for h2's is a bit too much I think

Scrolling down to the 'Schedule your free' 'Estimate today', using 2rem or 35px line height is a cleaner look
