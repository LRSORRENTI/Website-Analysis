## First impressions

**Appears to be using WordPress, pretty simplistic clean design, most pages follow a very uniform design strategy, use of a main hero image with h1 or h2 overlayed over, then below they utilize a checkerboard layout pattern usually providing a background offset div behind each main section image**

## Functionality Overview:

They link to a virtual fence builder mysalesman from all of their '
Get an Instant Estimate' buttons,

EX: https://www.chesterfieldfencingandmore.com/instant-fence-quote-online/

You pin on a map the area around your property, selecting material, color, and height which then output an estimate cost.

This is the tool CleverFox, and a lot of Fencing websites use for some of it's clients EX: https://www.allencountyfence.com/fence-estimate/

## The Good

- They implement an effective strategy around text overlay, use of thick font weight, with text shadow when overlaying text on images

- They use line height effectively for better readability on many of their content sections

- The text for all content sections is very legible

- Use of very subtle background gradients provides a clean look: background-image: linear-gradient(180deg, #0b4163, #125790);

## The Bad

- Some of the line-height for h2's is a bit too much I think EX: on this page https://www.chesterfieldfencingandmore.com/virginia-beach/gallery/
  Scrolling down to the 'Schedule your free' 'Estimate today', using 2rem or 35px line height is a cleaner look

- On some of the FAQ's like on this page https://www.chesterfieldfencingandmore.com/gate-installation/ when you toggle an FAQ item the background image zooms in and out, could be better visually if that didn't occur
