## First impressions

Looking under the hood it looks like it's not wordpress, it is linking to Bootstrap CDN, need to verify that

## The Good

Color palette jumps out to me straight away, clean use of white, soft white, light grey, and box shadows to create a clean modern look

The Sections that are using a background image with dark overlay and another container within also with a lighter version of that overlay looks nice, they seem to strategically use these compounding overlays to cleanly display white or light colored text over images

The Our Simple Process timeline with the dotted line connecting the steps is a clean look

Their design theory around font weight and size for each section is well structured

The way they anchor the h2 text & smaller text above it within the inside of the images on pages like https://gomrfence.com/fences/aluminum-fences/
is a clean look

Their of use of vimeo embed integrates nicely given their color palette, vimeo embeds in general have a clean look and their positioning of these elements next to text blocks are solidly designed EX on this page: https://gomrfence.com/fences/aluminum-fences/

## The bad

The 'areas we serve toggle' beneath the three column info section seems a bit visually lost, I think for UX it's not a great way to display content, I think for older users or visual impaired users that doesn't work well

Footer content alignment seems nice, there is gap in the
'Mr. Fence
1804 N Burkhardt Rd
Evansville, IN 47715'
part of the footer that would look cleaner if all were uniformly left aligned

Their of use of vimeo embed integrates nicely given their color palette, vimeo embeds in general have a clean look and their positioning of these elements next to text blocks are solidly designed EX on this page: https://gomrfence.com/fences/aluminum-fences/

Some general inconsistencies in the 'Instant Fence Estimator, Frequently Asked Questions, and Talk to the Fence Pros!' some text elements are left aligned, some are center aligned, this creates a disharmony in the design of the section, and actually on the https://gomrfence.com/testimonials/ page they address this issue, all of the above are text-align center
