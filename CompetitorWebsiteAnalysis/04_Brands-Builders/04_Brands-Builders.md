## Likely Tech Stack

- **Platform: Web.com Website Builder (or a white-labeled variant of it)**

- **Front-end Tech: HTML, CSS (autogenerated via web.com), and inline JavaScript (hidden in the page source)**

- **CDN/Image Hosting: lirp.cdn-website.com**

- **CMS-like Functionality: Yes, but abstracted away behind a visual interface â€” users don't code directly.**

## Initial Impressions

- Heavy use of background images in places where you'd normally put semantic html tags, h2's, h3's etc..

- The instant fence estimate image / graphic design of the iPhone screens layered on top of one another is a cool effect

- They have 60 total FAQ's

- The 'Our Expertise' section on the homepage is using a dark overlay wood background, has a cool effect and makes the foreground text really pop out

## The Good

- Strong hero container text, 'Quality Fence Solutions You Can Trust - Acadiana's Stronger Choice' is short and to the point, sets the tone of the webpage

- Their selective use of changing letter casing mid sentence like in 'Buying a FENCE in Lafayette With Our EASY Process' sticks out, makes those words the emphasis

- Their blog posts seem varied EX: Dog Fence Recommendations From a Top Lafayette, Louisiana Fence Company, this kind of content alongside the more traditional fencing material & style posts is a way to grab visitor's attention

## The Bad

- The sidenav has some strange spacing, not sure if that was their intended effect, but it may have been a more complete look if they included their logo within the side nav drawer along with maybe a yellow accent of some kind as well
