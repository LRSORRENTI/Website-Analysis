## First Impressions

Things that jump out at me straight away

- Color palette looks great

- I like the hover effect on the buttons, border transparent to border black is a really clean effect

- I really like the branded Picket Ridge Chevy Truck entrance animation on the page: https://www.picketridge.com/about-picket-ridge-fence-company/
  It looks like the car is driving into frame, very cool effect

- The location pages having the current weather widget for each area is a nice touch, provides a personal feeling to visitors of the website

- I like the prevalence of the google ratings, they serve their trust building purpose well

## Suggestions

1. On the page https://www.picketridge.com/elkhart-fence-company/ , the grey to orange section border appears a bit harsh, maybe switching one of the sections, either the top one's background to white, or the image grid bg to white would be a cleaner look, or alternatively some kind of gradient border between them, maybe even a wp border 

## Styling Discrepancy

On the https://www.picketridge.com/wood-fence-installation/#staining page, below the h2 'Wood Fence Photo Gallery' that button is missing the border color change hover effect
