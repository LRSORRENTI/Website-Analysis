# First Impressions

https://www.custerfence.com/

## Suggestions

- On this page https://www.custerfence.com/quick-fence-quote/ beneath the quote form is quite a lot of white-space underneath as you scroll down the page, I would tighten it a bit to improve page fidelity and improve UX. The topmost section looks great though, I really like the video background and the wide layered chevron overlay, looks very clean

- On this page https://www.custerfence.com/houston-fence-company/ if you scroll down to Custer Fence Mission section, the paragraph text is a bit hard to read, maybe altering the style of that for better readability

- On the https://www.custerfence.com/fence-types/wood-fence/ page, and the /fence-types pages in general I think having an h2 above the hero container paragraph with the title like 'Wood Fences' would be well-suited
