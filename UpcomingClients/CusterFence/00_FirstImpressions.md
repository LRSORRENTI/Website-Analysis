# First Impressions

https://www.custerfence.com/

The text animation beneath the Amazon, JC penney logos is very cool, eye-catching

## Suggestions

- On this page https://www.custerfence.com/quick-fence-quote/ beneath the quote form is quite a lot of white-space underneath as you scroll down the page, I would tighten it a bit to improve page fidelity and improve UX. The topmost section looks great though, I really like the video background and the wide layered chevron overlay, looks very clean

- On this page https://www.custerfence.com/houston-fence-company/ if you scroll down to Custer Fence Mission section, the paragraph text is a bit hard to read, maybe altering the style of that for better readability

- On the https://www.custerfence.com/fence-types/wood-fence/ page, and the /fence-types pages in general I think having an h2 above the hero container paragraph with the title like 'Wood Fences' would be well-suited

- I noticed some of the city pages like https://www.custerfence.com/sugar-land-fence-company/ and https://www.custerfence.com/pearland-fence-company/ have differing styles, would those need to be shifted to one style or the other?

- In a similar vein the city page links in the footer all work, but in the top nav under 'About Us' then 'Locations' that nav doesn't include all the city pages

- Small styling quirk is in the footer there's this list of hours, and there is a gap / space between the opening time and AM but no gap between the PM
  Monday 8:00 AM-5:00PM
  Tuesday 8:00 AM-5:00PM
  Wednesday 8:00 AM-5:00PM
  Thursday 8:00 AM-5:00PM
  Friday 8:00 AM-5:00PM
  Saturday 8:00 AM-12:00PM

- In a similar vein on tablet size the footer item containers, the address, phone, and email seem to go from align-center, then below the hours go to align-left, I'd consolidate it one way or another for both

- On iPad air tablet size in the chrome dev tools the google reviews appears above the nav on this page https://www.custerfence.com/fence-types/wood-fence/ this appears at the 768px breakpoint and above and remains above the nav until the 1024px breakpoint
