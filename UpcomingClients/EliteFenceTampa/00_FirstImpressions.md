# Elite Fence Tampa Bay

https://elitefenceandoutdoor.com/

- I noticed on the https://elitefenceandoutdoor.com/resources/ page that some of the materials don't have clickable download links, is this due to Elite Fence needing to provide those materials? Do they usually scan them themselves and upload them or does Clever Fox handle that part?

Also on the page https://elitefenceandoutdoor.com/commercial-fence-projects/security-fencing/ and all of the /commercial-fence-projects routes the main 'Get A Commercial Quote' button doesn't correctly link to anything, I fixed this by adding the css id of #comquote to the section below that it's supposed to scroll to

On this page https://elitefenceandoutdoor.com/commercial-fence-projects/ag-and-wildlife-fencing/ the section containing
'Round-Rail Fencing
2-Rail Fencing
3-Rail Fencing
4-Rail Fencing
Crossbuck Fencing
No-Climb Fencing
Hogwire Fencing
Custom Fencing'
Could be re-designed a bit for better visual fidelity?

I noticed in the drop down for 'Outdoor Living Services' in the nav, there are two 'Pergola & Arbor Installation' links, the second one actually links to https://elitefenceandoutdoor.com/other-services/paver-installation/, I'll change that link to say 'Paver Installations' instead
