# What’s Working Well

1. Clear Structure and Organization:

The footer is neatly divided into four key areas: Company Overview, Resources, About Us, and Contact Info.

Each column is logically grouped and labeled with clear headings.

2. Strong Local SEO and Service Area Signals:

The Service Area list is a smart move—it reinforces local presence and helps for local keyword ranking (Tampa, Riverview, Lakeland, etc.).

Highlighting cities with links (assuming they go to location-specific pages or sections) is excellent for both SEO and user clarity.

3. Verified Location & Reviews:

Including a Google Map embed with star rating and review count adds strong trust signals.

It also gives users quick access to directions or a full review page.

4. Branded and Professional Visual Design:

The logo reuse at the top-left of the footer ties it back to the overall brand.

The white and blue color scheme matches the rest of the site, maintaining visual consistency.

5. Contact Information Is Clear:

The phone number and address are easy to locate.

Great that the company name is spelled out next to the address (helps with citation consistency in SEO).

Suggestions for Improvement

1. Tighten Text in the Company Overview:

The opening paragraph has a minor grammar hiccup:

“Choosing Elite Fence and Outdoor of Tampa Bay for your next fence is great choice.”
Should be:
“...for your next fence is a great choice.”

Also consider shortening the paragraph slightly to focus more on benefit-driven language.

2. Add Social Link Tooltips or Alt Text:

The icons (Google, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest) are clean, but they lack labels.

Add alt text and hover titles for accessibility and clarity (e.g., "Follow us on Instagram").

3. Improve the Flow of the Embedded Map:

The Google Map feels visually cramped at the bottom-right.

Consider:

Slightly reducing its width

Adding spacing/margin around it

Wrapping it in a subtle border or shadow to separate it from the text

4. Footer Navigation Link Enhancements:

The “Resources” and “About Us” columns are solid, but a few links (like "Elite Brochure" or "Elite Fence LinkTree") could benefit from more descriptive naming:

Example: “Download Our Brochure” or “Quick Access Directory (LinkTree)”

5. Legal & Accessibility Considerations:

The bottom bar mentions copyright, but lacks:

Privacy Policy link

Terms of Service link

These are typically required and expected, especially if collecting customer info or using cookies.

Optional Enhancements
Add a Back to Top Button: Helps users quickly return to the top, especially on mobile.

Newsletter CTA (if applicable): If they do email marketing, the footer is a great place to invite sign-ups (e.g., “Get Fence Maintenance Tips”).

Live Chat Prompt or Badge: Could be embedded just above or beside the map if offered.
