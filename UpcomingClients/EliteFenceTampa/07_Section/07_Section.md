# What’s Working Well

1. Clear, Action-Oriented Headline:

“Get an Instant Quote” is direct, benefits-focused, and clearly positioned as a next step in the user journey.

2. Friendly Supporting Copy:

The language is approachable: “It’s quick, it’s easy, and there is no obligation!”

It eliminates friction and encourages engagement by emphasizing low commitment.

3. Strong Button Design:

The yellow CTA button is high-contrast, consistent with the site's brand palette, and clearly labeled as a tool, not just a generic "Contact Us."

Button label “Use Our Pricing Tool” clarifies the action and differentiates it from phone/email inquiries.

4. Reinforcing Visual:

The image of team members actively working and smiling adds personality and trust.

Blue frame around the image ties it nicely into the site’s branding.

Suggestions for Improvement

1. Strengthen the Hook:

The section feels a bit transactional. Adding a small benefit statement above the heading could increase urgency and click-through.

Example:

“Find Out What Your New Fence Will Cost in Just 60 Seconds”

2. Tighten Text Layout:

The text body is clean, but could benefit from slight visual separation above the button.

Add a little more margin between the paragraph and the button to create a smoother rhythm and visual pause before the CTA.

3. Consider Emphasizing Locality:

This tool is for Tampa-area customers — reinforce that in the button itself or subtext:

Example button: “Get My Tampa Fence Quote”

4. Improve Mobile Responsiveness:

Ensure the text and image stack neatly on mobile. Right now, the image might stack awkwardly below the button or push it too far down the page.

Optional Enhancements
Add microanimation to button on hover: A subtle scale or color darkening helps reinforce interactivity.

A/B test label variations: Try alternatives like “Estimate Your Fence” or “Start Instant Quote” to test user engagement over time.

Inline trust reinforcement: One short testimonial quote or Google rating icon near the button could subtly increase conversion.
