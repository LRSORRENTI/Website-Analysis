# What’s Working Well

1. Strong Trust Signals:

The three columns—“Family Owned & Operated,” “Fully Insured,” and “Top-Rated Contractor”—quickly convey professionalism and credibility.

Short, benefits-focused blurbs make the section easy to skim.

2. Clear Visual Structure:

The icon + headline + description format is consistent and clean.

Good use of white space gives breathing room and avoids visual clutter.

3. Effective Transition Into Product Area:

“Types of Fences” is a natural follow-up and is clearly labeled.

The subheading “Central Florida’s Most Popular” adds localized relevance.

4. Strong Call to Action:

The “View All Fence Options” button is bold, well-placed, and high contrast—easy to spot and click.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Improve Icon Visibility or Style Cohesion:

The current icons are clean but somewhat minimal and may not stand out enough from a distance or on lower resolution screens.

Consider either increasing icon size slightly or switching to a bolder icon style that matches the strong font weight used elsewhere.

2. Add Visual Hierarchy Between Sections:

The boundary between the trust column row and the “Types of Fences” section feels a little abrupt.

Suggest adding a subtle divider, angled background, or overlapping visual to guide the eye downward more fluidly.

3. Strengthen Copy for Differentiation:

All three trust blurbs are solid, but a bit generic.

Example improvement:
Instead of “We are proud to provide…”, try:
“You’ll get hands-on service from our Tampa-based family team—no outsourcing, ever.”

Optional Enhancements
Hover Interaction: Add a subtle hover effect (e.g., shadow lift or icon animation) on the trust columns to improve engagement and interactivity.

Add a micro-CTA under each card: A small link like “Learn More About Our Process” could lead to an About page or FAQ for users who want to dig deeper.
