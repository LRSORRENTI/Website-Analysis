## Nav Hierarchy

The nav section on the https://www.fenceguys.com/fence-repairs/ route contains quite a lot of nav items

### Suggested Design Improvements

1. Convert to a Dropdown or Accordion-Based Mega Menu
Example:
“Fence Companies by City” dropdown or expandable accordion that reveals cities grouped by region.

Keeps top nav clean and still SEO-friendly if implemented with proper <a> tags inside the menu.

2. Use a Grid Layout with Visual Breaks
Organize cities into 3–4 columns with section headers (e.g., "Northwest AR", "Central AR").

Add padding and line-height between rows for better readability.

3. Add Search or Filter Capability
Add a search input above the list: “Find your city…”

On input, dynamically filter the cities using JavaScript.

4. Consider Icon or Flag Markers
Use map pin icons or subtle AR state outlines as background styling to reinforce location context visually.

5. Mobile Optimization
Collapse the list into an expandable accordion per city group or show a scrollable carousel of city cards with “See All” link.
