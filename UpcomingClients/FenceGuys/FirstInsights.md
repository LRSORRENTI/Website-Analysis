## Notes

On the page https://www.fenceguys.com/online-fence-estimate/, right above the mysalesman section there's a null prefix before Rogers, not sure if that's supposed to be there:
null
Rogers,
AR 72758
479-721-6783
Support@fenceguys.com

Also on that same page the 'Get An Instant Quote' button in the top nav has blue text color, which deviates from the normal white text color for that button on other pages

On the https://www.fenceguys.com/gates-operators/ page, on tablet view the 'Automatic Gate Openers & More' heading could use some margin or padding top to space a bit away from the image

On the https://www.fenceguys.com/about-fence-guys/#payment-info page, underneath the venmo tab, there's a sentence that reads 'We can currently accept payments through Venmo. Payments made through Venmo are not subject to any additional fees.' I think changing it to either 'We currently' or 'We can' instead of 'We can currently' is better grammatically

## FAQS Duplicates

There's some duplicate FAQ's inside of the https://www.fenceguys.com/faqs/ route
Pine Fence FAQs
What are the advantages of a Pine Fence?
What are the advantages of a Pine Fence?
What are the advantages of a Pine Fence?

Also within FAQ's, under Chain Link Fence, there's an FAQ that reads 'Does Chain Link Fence require maintenance?' maybe would be better asked as 'Do chain link fences require maintenance?'

## Nav Hierarchy

The nav section on the https://www.fenceguys.com/fence-repairs/ route contains quite a lot of nav items

### Suggested Design Improvements

1. Convert to a Dropdown or Accordion-Based Mega Menu
   Example:
   “Fence Companies by City” dropdown or expandable accordion that reveals cities grouped by region.

Keeps top nav clean and still SEO-friendly if implemented with proper <a> tags inside the menu.

2. Use a Grid Layout with Visual Breaks
   Organize cities into 3–4 columns with section headers (e.g., "Northwest AR", "Central AR").

Add padding and line-height between rows for better readability.

3. Add Search or Filter Capability
   Add a search input above the list: “Find your city…”

On input, dynamically filter the cities using JavaScript.

4. Consider Icon or Flag Markers
   Use map pin icons or subtle AR state outlines as background styling to reinforce location context visually.

5. Mobile Optimization
   Collapse the list into an expandable accordion per city group or show a scrollable carousel of city cards with “See All” link.
