# What’s Working Well

1. Clean, Grid-Based Layout:

- The 2-row, 3-column layout is well-balanced and readable.

- Each fencing type is clearly segmented with a photo, making it easy to browse at a glance.

2. Strong Visual Clarity:

- The photos are bright, high-resolution, and clearly show the fence type in real settings.

- Good variety shown: residential, commercial, and urban applications (e.g., iron fencing near brick architecture).

3. Simple, Readable Labels:

- Each fencing category has a bold, white-on-blue label, clearly identifying the type.

- Consistent typographic style maintains brand cohesion with the site's main palette.

4. Dark Background Creates Contrast:

- The dark grey background helps the photos and category labels stand out sharply, directing attention to the product options.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Add Hover Interactivity:

- Currently, it appears static — no hover state or visual feedback.

Recommend adding a hover effect:

- Slight scale-up or shadow

- Label highlight or underline

- Example: border-top or transition revealing a "Learn More" button

2. Add Click Destination or CTA:

- Are these images clickable? If not, users may assume they are and get frustrated.

- Each card should ideally link to a dedicated fence type page (e.g., /wood-fencing, /chain-link, etc.)

- Add a subtle hover CTA like:

“Explore Wood Fencing”

“View Vinyl Fence Styles”

3. Adjust Label Padding or Typography (Mobile):

- Make sure text labels stay readable on smaller screens.

- Increase vertical padding or slightly reduce font size so labels don't appear cramped or overflow.

4. Consider Category Grouping or Filtering (Optional):

- If more categories will be added in the future, consider allowing filtering or segmenting:

- Residential vs. Commercial

- Material Type (Metal, Wood, Composite)

## Optional Enhancements

- Accessibility: Ensure alt text to all images for screen reader users and SEO.

- Consistent Aspect Ratios: Ensure all thumbnails use a fixed ratio (e.g., 4:3 or 16:9) so the cards align perfectly regardless of image dimension.
