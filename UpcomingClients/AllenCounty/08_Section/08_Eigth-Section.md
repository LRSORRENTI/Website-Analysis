# What’s Working Well

1. Embedded Google Map:

Having a map with the pin, reviews, and directions builds trust and reinforces local presence.

It’s clickable and functional, which is useful for mobile users needing quick directions.

2. Clear Branding and Contact Info:

The logo is reused in the footer, which reinforces brand consistency.

The phone number is prominent and includes a phone icon — great for user clarity and mobile tap-to-call usability.

3. Service Area Statement:

The line:
“Providing Quality Fencing & Construction Across The Entire Northeast Indiana Area Since 2020”
reinforces credibility and adds a sense of longevity and regional authority.

Suggestions for Improvement

1. Section Visual Flow:

The black background bar with the company name directly above the map feels slightly abrupt.

Suggestion: Soften the transition with a gradient or horizontal line divider, or move the heading “Allen County Fence Company” above the map, and integrate it into the section above.

2. Contact Details Enhancement:

Consider also including:

An email address

A physical address line (even though it’s on the map, it’s good for accessibility and SEO)

Business hours (if applicable)

3. Footer Navigation (Optional):

There’s no site-wide footer menu. Adding links to key pages (e.g., Home, Estimate, Contact, Fence Types) can improve UX, SEO, and accessibility.

This is especially useful for mobile or late-stage users scanning quickly.

4. Add Schema Markup:

This section is perfect for Local Business schema with:

@type: LocalBusiness

Name, address, phone, geo-coordinates, and sameAs for Google Maps

Helps Google tie together location and contact data in search results

Optional Enhancements
Back to Top Button: Including a small floating “↑ Top” button would be helpful for users reaching the bottom of a long homepage.

Newsletter Signup or CTA: If relevant, consider adding a footer CTA, like:

“Get seasonal fence maintenance tips — join our email list.”

Accessibility Review: Ensure text color contrast in the footer meets WCAG standards — especially the light gray on black.

## Final Thoughts

This footer is functional and clean, with all the key basics. With some minor layout refinements and added info like hours, links, or email, it could be a fully polished, conversion-friendly close to the site.
