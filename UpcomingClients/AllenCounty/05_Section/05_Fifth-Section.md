# What’s Working Well

1. Strong Visual Impact:

The before/after sliders instantly show the transformation value the company delivers. That’s powerful social proof.

The photography is clear, well-lit, and diverse in styles—showcasing different fence types and environments.

2. Effective CTA Placement:

“CHECK OUT OUR WORK PORTFOLIO” button is high-contrast and centered—great placement and clarity.

The CTA is actionable and encourages deeper engagement.

3. Clean, Focused Layout:

Minimal text keeps the focus on the visuals.

Symmetrical grid layout is balanced and clean.

Blue underline on the headline adds some subtle flair and hierarchy.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Background Color Choice:

The solid gray background feels heavy and slightly dated.

Suggestion: Use a lighter neutral (off-white or soft blue/gray) or even a subtle texture to lift the feel.

Alternatively, you could use a gradient background to add modern polish.

2. Improve Text Contrast and Hierarchy:

“Transform Your Yard... With A New Fence!” is great, but it blends into the background a bit.

Consider either:

Increasing font weight or size,

Or adding a subtle drop shadow or glow for legibility on all screen types.

3. Add Section Context or Trust Signal:

Consider a subheading like:
“See how our expert installation transforms curb appeal and property value.”

Helps set the tone and invite viewers to scroll further.

4. Optimize Spacing Below Button:

The space between the CTA and the photo grid could use a bit more breathing room to better separate text from imagery.


# Optional Enhancements

Add a Hover Effect: Consider a slight zoom or lightbox on hover to allow users to click for a closer view or testimonial attached to each project.

Label the Photos: A small overlay in the corner (e.g., "Aluminum Fence – Fort Wayne") can reinforce location relevance and product types.
