# What’s Working Well

1. Clear, Organized Layout:

- The use of accordion-style questions in two columns is clean and intuitive.

- Important, common questions are addressed (cost, slope fencing, service area, warranty, etc.).

2. Well-Written Answers:

- Responses are clear and educational — for example, the answer about fencing on slopes explains the why behind their process and positions their custom work as a strength.

- Use of bold headers for each question improves scanability.

3. Helpful Internal Link:

- "Quick quote form" link in the cost section helps guide users toward a CTA without being overly salesy.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1. Improve Readability (Contrast & Typography):

- The white-on-blue text in the expanded panels has low contrast and is a bit hard to read.

- Suggestion: Lighten the background slightly (e.g., #2e3b8c) or darken the text (#f1f1f1) for better legibility.

- Consider increasing line height slightly to improve text flow.

2. Add a Section Introduction:

- Consider a short intro sentence above the FAQ header like:

**“Got questions about fencing, installation, or pricing? We’ve got you covered.”**

3. Icons:

- The eye-shaped icon feels generic and doesn’t reinforce the Q&A nature of the content.

- Use question mark, dropdown arrow, or plus/minus icons to clarify interactivity.

4. Mobile Optimization Tip:

- Ensure this 2-column layout collapses cleanly into a single column on small screens.

- On mobile, accordion items should have enough spacing between them to avoid accidental taps.

## Optional Enhancements

- Track Engagement (for improvement):

- Use Google Tag Manager to track FAQ clicks. It can help reveal which concerns are most important to users.

## Schema Markup for SEO:

- Add FAQ structured data (JSON-LD) for rich snippets in Google Search. This can enhance visibility in search results.
