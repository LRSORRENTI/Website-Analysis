# Allen County Fence 

## Initial Observations 

### Hero Section 

#### What’s Working Well

1. Clear Branding:

The logo is simple, relevant (fence imagery), and positioned top-left as expected.

The header includes geographic targeting (“Fort Wayne, IN”) and the business name—good for local SEO.

2. Immediate Value Proposition:

“Residential & Commercial Fencing” is front and center, with supporting text (“Northeast Indiana’s #1 Choice”) — strong clarity.

3. Strong CTA:

The “Get a Quote” section stands out with contrasting blue.

Use of urgency in “Don’t Wait” is smart for conversion.

4. Navigation is Organized:

Dropdown menus under key sections like “Fence Types” and “Commercial Projects” suggest depth and help structure content well.

#### Suggestions for Improvement

1. Header Hierarchy & Clarity:

The top tagline “Northeast Indiana’s #1 Choice” is slightly lost visually — consider either:

Reducing the font size slightly and/or

Adding a subtle shadow or semi-opaque background behind the text to ensure readability against the photo.

2. Text Contrast Over Image:

The main headline has good contrast, but it may lose clarity on smaller screens or in sunlight glare.

Suggestion: Add a dark overlay (e.g., background: rgba(0,0,0,0.3)) behind the hero image to ensure consistent readability.

3. Header Bar Optimization (Top Right):

The phone icon and number are helpful, but feel slightly cramped.

Add some padding or shift them closer to the center on wider screens.

Consider making the number a “click-to-call” link for mobile devices.

4. Button Visual Hierarchy:

The cyan “Get a Free Quote Online” button is a good accent, but:

Consider increasing padding and adding a hover effect for a more interactive feel.

“Don’t Wait. Get A Quote Now!” could be improved with a bolder or larger font weight to match the urgency.

5. Responsiveness Check:

Ensure the text and buttons don’t overlap or become too small on tablets/mobiles.

Particularly the menu and hero headline – consider a hamburger menu or collapsing text blocks.

#### Optional Enhancement Ideas

Add a Trust Badge or Rating: “#1 Choice” is great, but backing that with “500+ 5-Star Reviews” or a Google badge could boost credibility.

Hero Video Background Option: If they have installation footage, a subtle looping video could increase engagement without hurting load time (compressed properly).

Geo-Based CTA: Add location targeting like “Serving Fort Wayne and surrounding areas” under the quote CTA.
