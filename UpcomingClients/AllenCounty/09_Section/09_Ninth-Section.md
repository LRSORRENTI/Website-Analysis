# What’s Working Well

1. Full Contact Details:

Includes phone number, business hours, physical address, and links to social media and Google — excellent for user access and local SEO.

Google and BBB widgets enhance trust and legitimacy.

2. Clear Service Area Coverage:

Listing of cities (e.g., Auburn, Angola, Huntertown) gives geographic confidence and local reach transparency.

Blue map icons are a nice visual touch and consistent with the brand’s blue accent color.

3. Clean Layout & Branding:

Reuses the logo effectively to anchor the footer visually.

Includes copyright, privacy policy, and sitemap — good for SEO and compliance.

4. Developer Credit Handled Tastefully:

“Website Design & Digital Marketing by Clever Fox Online” is subtle, non-intrusive, and professional.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Add a Footer Navigation Menu (if possible):

Right now there’s no secondary nav. Including a footer menu with links to key pages (e.g., Fence Types, Estimate, About Us) would:

Improve UX for users scrolling all the way down

Help SEO via internal linking

Increase accessibility for keyboard/tab users

2. Improve City Layout Structure:

Make the icons uniform in alignment, so they look more like a structured bulleted list

The city listing is currently centered and stacked, which is readable but could be easier to scan.

Suggestion: Use a 2-column or 3-column layout on desktop and stack on mobile. This would compact the content and balance whitespace better.

3. Add an Email Contact Option:

Many users prefer email. If there’s a monitored address (e.g., info@allencountyfence.com), list it near the phone number.

4. Consider a Quick Quote CTA:

A final footer CTA like:

“Get a Free Fence Estimate Today” Button
could help capture interest from scrollers who reach the end of the page.

Optional Enhancements
Newsletter or Offers Signup: If relevant, offer users a chance to sign up for seasonal maintenance reminders or promotions.

Accessibility Check: Ensure that all text meets contrast ratios (e.g., light gray on black is fine but double check contrast with WCAG 2.1 AA).

Responsive Audit: On small screens, make sure icons don’t stack awkwardly or push the address block too far down.

## Final Thoughts

This is a well-structured footer that covers the essentials cleanly and professionally. With a few adjustments — mostly around navigation, layout tightening, and minor UX tweaks — it’ll feel even more polished and conversion-friendly.
