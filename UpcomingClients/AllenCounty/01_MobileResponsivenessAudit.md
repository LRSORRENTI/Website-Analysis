# Mobile Responsiveness Audit

## Navigation

All nav links appear to be working on mobile, all are pressable and correctly link to their respective pages

## General Observations

On the https://www.allencountyfence.com/fence-types/wood-fences/ I think the 'Contact Us' buttons on both mobile and tablet could be enhanced with a bit of margin top, spacing down from the paragraph text above

On the https://www.allencountyfence.com/fence-styles/semi-privacy-fence-installation/ page, I noticed there are no accompanied images for that style of fence, I think adding example images similar to the other /fence-style route pages would be a good fit
