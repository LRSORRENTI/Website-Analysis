# Madison Fence

## First impressions:

Home page is very visually clean, the Madison Fence logo is really cool.

Scrolling down the 'Why choose Madison Fence' section with the semi-transparent overlay makes the text within much easier to read, really pops out which is good

The https://www.gomadisonfence.com/resources/ page, there's quite a lot of examples of wood fences, not as many examples of Vinyl Fences, Aluminum Fences, Steel Fences, Chain Link Fences, Fence Staining

On the city pages like https://www.gomadisonfence.com/verona-fence-company/ I think the paragraph text under the h2 is a bit hard to read, probably could be improved with a font-weight increase

## Suggestions

- On this page https://www.gomadisonfence.com/online-fence-estimator/ it seems like the main 'GET A FENCE QUOTE' text is cut off at the top on desktop? It looks like on mobile, and tablet it's fine. This bug could be local to my computer, need to look at it further

- On this page 'https://www.gomadisonfence.com/privacy-fence-3/' scrolling down to the section with 'Other Types Of Fence We Install' heading, the paragraph text below is difficult to read, I'd try to make the text a bit more legible with font-weight increase or some other method to help readability, like on the homepage there's a darker opacity overlay that makes it easier to read:on the home page Scrolling down the 'Why choose Madison Fence' section with the semi-transparent overlay makes the text within much easier to read, really pops out which is good
