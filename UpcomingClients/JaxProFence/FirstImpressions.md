# First impressions

1. On the https://www.jaxprofence.com/resources/ page the downloadable resources are not present, they just link back to the https://www.jaxprofence.com/resources/ page when pressed, are they supposed to be downloadable files?

2. On the About us dropdown, then the service area drop down the Worcester MA, Shrewsbery MA, Westborough MA, Hartford CT, Manchester CT, and New Britain CT links are broken

3. It looks like the knowledge library on the https://www.jaxprofence.com/category/knowledge-library/ route, doesn't contain as many blog or article posts as FenceGuys or some of the other Clever Fox website knowledge libraries

4. On the https://www.jaxprofence.com/privacy-fence/ page, scrolling down to the two 'See Privacy Fence Gallery' links, they appear to link to a 'https://www.jaxprofence.com/privacy-fence/#portfolio' but that link isn't working for me, maybe add the # id of portfolio below on that h2 'Privacy Fence Photo Gallery' so that it scrolls down?

5. On the vinyl-fence-installation/ page, the paragraph text under the h2 'Other Types Of Fence We Install' is a bit hard to read, maybe introducing text shadow, or some css to alleviate that low-readability

6. On the https://www.jaxprofence.com/commercial-fences/ page, scrolling down to the 'Request a bid' button below 'Jobsite Fencing' there appears to be an overlayed div making the button difficult to press? Checking in the chrome dev tools, adding a css class of position: relative, and z-index: 1 to the button seems to fix this bug
