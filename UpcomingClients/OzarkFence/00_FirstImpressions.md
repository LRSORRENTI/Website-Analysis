# Ozark Fence

https://www.ozfence.com/

Home page is clean, I think the border top in the style of a fence of the 'Why choose Ozark' section is a cool touch

Well structured footer, good alignement and legibility of items

Very cool 3D flip animations for the info container sections, this is definitely eye-catching for users, also the use of box shadow on these enhances the 3D look

The border top above the 'Perimeter Commercial Fence' is a great effect, the outline of the fence gives that section great character

Text is very legible, contrast between text color and backgrounds, along with selective use of font-weight creates sections that are easy to read

The https://www.ozfence.com/resources/ page where the hero section pulls in youtube videos, and displays the view count, comment count etc is a cool feature

For the city pages, I noticed that https://www.ozfence.com/strafford-fence-company/ and https://www.ozfence.com/fair-grove-fence-company/ have different looking hero containers than all the rest of the city pages

## Suggestions

- On the https://www.ozfence.com/fence-installation/aluminum-fence/ page, or any of the /fence-installation pages, there's an FAQ section that might read better with 'Our experienced team has compiled an FAQ section to help answer any questions you may have.' instead of the current 'Our experienced team has compiled a FAQ to help answer any questions you may have.' Although it might not matter that much

- On mobile and tablet, scroll down to just above the footer, the 'Call Now' button could use some margin-top, maybe just 5 - 10px

- On tablet view, in the section 'Ozark Fence Performance & Advantages' the icons on the left of the progress or increment bars aren't aligned, they seem to shift as the screen size grows / shrinks
