# Initial Impressions / Notes

##On this page https://truelinefencecompany.com/commercial-fence-projects/
The way that each section has the tri-color border separator sort've at an angle is very clean, looks awesome

Some of the city pages return 404 page not found, maybe need to be built ?

## Form Centering:

On this page https://truelinefencecompany.com/fence-types/wood-fence/ the form field seems cut off and not centered within the div or parent element

The contact form on the main page https://truelinefencecompany.com/, would look cleaner if the form elements were centered, and maybe had an additonal padding on all four sides?

I noticed in the footer these links don't have the same hover effect text color change as the other footer items: USEFUL LINKS
