Again, this isn't meant to overwhelm you. It is just to give you an idea of which clients we plan to assign to you. Currently, all of these projects are up-to-date and on track - with exception to OK Vinyl (needs to be built - you and I will work on) and Fence Masters (which is under development with Ella).

Here is the list:

Allen County Fence
Custer Fence
Elite Fence & Outdoor of Tampa Bay
Fence Guys
Heritage Fence LLC (Tennessee)
Jax Pro Fence
Log Cabin Fence & Structures
Madison Fence
OK Vinyl
Ozark Fence
True Line Fence
Spring Valley Fence
We will go over these individually in detail. I just wanted to give you a quick list in case you wanted to scope them out and get a lay of the land.

See you at the Monday.com session later today!
Thank You,
